<h2> Hey there! I'm Jon Wang.</h2>

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻  About Me </h3>

🤔 What do you like to do?
    I like to learn more about the cloud technologies as the industry is trending in that direction. I want to be able to apply all my experience and knowledge in this field and have impact wherever I go.

🎓 What's your educational background?
    I studied Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech and worked for a FAANG company for over 7 years with my latest role being a Systems Engineer working in the DevOps world.

💼 What are you planning on doing for work?
    I plan on becoming either a Sr. DevOps Engineer with a big scope picture of the entire DevOps architecture and be a SME wherever I go. Ultimately I want to lead a DevOps team and be a people manager and develop others.

🌱 Currently working on learning everything about DevOps and improving my own knowledge about it.
